This directory is organised as an R environment, which means all packages and their specific versions have been saved within R environment lock file. This directory is organised as an R project, however the selective alignment scripts have also been included. 

The data folder has been ommited due to the size of the git repo, however the code here is completely reproducible and so, upon running, the data and results can be generated for this project.

To get started, simply reload the version-specific packages used in this project by running `renv::restore`
